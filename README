# PoC||GTFO
If you are unfamiliar with the
[_International Journal of Proof-of-Concept or Get The F*ck Out_](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) (my edit)
then I encourage you, dear reader, to become familiar with it. It is a great read by hackers for hackers.

## Long story short
One thing geeks like myself have taken to doing, is preserving the history of the internet by replicating information to
sites and servers with better control. That is why I have created this repo, which automatically updates daily (thanks
Github Workflows!)

You can view my mirror of the site at https://utahcon.github.io/pocorgtfo

## Join the fun!

### Calm yourself
There isn't new content daily, but it will run a Github Workflow daily to make sure that if something new appears on the
main PoC||GTFO page, it will be replicated here. Enjoy!
